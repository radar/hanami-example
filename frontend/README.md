## Frontend

The frontend application is a [React](https://reactjs.org/) + [React Router](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/core/guides/philosophy) + [Apollo](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/) JavaScript application, that uses Flow, ESLint, Babel, etc. Check out `package.json`.

This application originated from a `create-react-app` project that I ejected from as I needed more customisations than `create-react-app` could provide me -- like Sass support. I _cannot_ code CSS (and enjoy myself) without Sass.

### Setting up

To setup the frontend app, you can run:

```
yarn install
```

Then you can run this app by running:

```
yarn start
```
